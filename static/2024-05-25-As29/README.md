Dear Students and Parents,

Good afternoon. Today, we had a fun and productive class! We reviewed Chinese Pinyin, characters, words, and sentences we've learned so far through group competitions and games.

I kindly ask parents to help your child correct the mistakes on his/her workbooks. Next Saturday, we will have our fourth unit test, so it's important for everyone to review thoroughly and be prepared.

I've attached a summary of the key points from our textbook for your reference. Please use it to help with your studying.

Homework for this week:
1.Pages 80 to 84 in the textbook: "总练习".
2.Correct the errors found in workbook 1A and 1B.
3.Read the Pinyin list aloud once daily, and write it from memory twice before next week's class.
4.Pick three texts from the textbook and read them aloud twice a day .
5.Review "中文1 总结.pdf" to identify and fill in any knowledge gaps.

Best regards,
Zhen
