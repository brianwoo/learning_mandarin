 Dear parents and students,


Good afternoon. Today we started by quickly reviewing characters and sentences. After that, we spent about 60 min completing the last quiz. After we finished the test, we learned a Tang poetry -- “静夜思”. The test results will be sent to your email individually by this Friday.

For students who were absent today, please have parents assist in printing the test papers and spend 60 min completing the quiz, then take photos of the completed papers and send them to me via email by Friday.  
 
For this week, please do the following practice:
1. Redo the the test.
2.Correct the errors that appear in the Chinese workbook 1A and 1B. 
Please keep the wrong content and write the correct answer next to it with a different color pen. If there are any unfinished exercises, please make up for them.
3. Read and recite the Tang poetry“静夜思”
 
I would like to inform you that Saturday, June 8th, will be our final class for this term. Additionally, we are excited to announce that our graduation ceremony will be held on Sunday, June 16th, from 12:00 PM to 2:45 PM at the South Campus (Robert Warren School, Gymnasium, 12424 Elbow Dr. SW, Calgary). During the ceremony, our class will perform a recital of Tang poetry as a group. I kindly request that all students attend the ceremony on time.

If your child wishes to do a solo performance, please respond to this message, and I will provide you with further details regarding the performance.

Thank you for your support, and have a wonderful weekend.




家长们、同学们，

下午好。今天我们在课上先用15分钟快速复习了重点汉字和句子，用60分钟完成了第四次单元测试。最后利用剩余时间，我们学习了一首唐诗《静夜思》。本次测试结果会在下周五前单独发送给各位家长。我已将本次测试题目和答案附加到此封邮件。

今天缺席的同学，请家长协助打印试卷，本周用60分钟，完成测试内容。这周五之前请将完成的试卷拍照后通过电子邮件传给我，进行成绩统计。

 
请同学们用本周时间完成以下练习：
1. 重新做一遍测试题目。
2. 修改中文练习册1A和1B中出现的错误。请保留写错的内容，用不同颜色的笔把正确答案写在旁边。如果有未完成的练习，请补做。
3. 朗读并背诵唐诗《静夜思》

请大家注意6月8日周六为本学习最后一次课。6月16日周日12pm-2:45pm我们会在南校区（Robert Warren School, Gymnasium, 12424 Elbow Dr. SW, Calgary) 举行结业典礼，我们班会以班级形式表演唐诗朗诵，希望孩子们能按时参加。如果您的孩子希望单独表演一个节目，请您回复我，我会告知您表演事宜。
