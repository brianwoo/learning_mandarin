Dear parents and students,

Good afternoon.
In today's class we started our session with a review of Pinyin through a game called "finding friends", ask your child how to play it.  After that, we’ve started learning Unit 11. In the lesson, we focused on the text “认方向Directions” and learned the pronunciation and meanings of nine characters: 认、方、向、面、太、阳、东、西、北、南. Following that, we practiced writing these characters together and did some word formation exercises using these characters. During revision, students need to distinguish between homophones like "东" and "冬", "阳" and "羊". When writing the radical "阝" of "阳", the first stroke is横撇弯勾, please avoiding writing it as two strokes. When writing "南", pay attention to the inside being "¥" (with one less horizontal stroke than "羊"). One of the important part of this unit is learning directional nouns in Chinese. In class, we identified directions based on the sunshine, and then I encouraged students to use the sentence pattern "我的...是..." to say the names of their classmates around them. Everyone could actively participate and speak bravely. Good job!

After class, please complete the following exercises：
1.Listen to the recording and repeat the text, words and phrases on page 63 to 66 from Unit 11 of the Chinese textbook. Read and recite text “Directions”.
2.Complete exercises from page 68 to 83 in Chinese workbook 1A.
3.Review Unit 18 of Pinyin textbook.
4.If you haven’t finished “Unit 10 汉字书写练习”, please keep doing it. You need a printer to print out the PDF.

We will keep working on Unit 11 next week. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. 
Have a great weekend and see you in the next class.

家长朋友们同学们，

下午好。今天我们通过游戏“找朋友”进行了拼音的复习，之后学习了中文第十一单元。通过学习课文《认方向》，我们学习了10个汉字（认、方、向、面、太、阳、东、西、北、南）的读音和含义，然后我们一起练习了这些汉字的书写，并用这些汉字进行了组词练习。复习时需要同学们区分同音字“东”和“冬”， “阳”和“羊”。书写“阳”的偏旁左耳刀“阝”时，第一笔为横撇弯钩，避免写成两笔。书写“南”时，注意内部是“¥”（“羊”字少一横）。本单元的重点内容之一是学习中文里的方位名词。在课上我们一起根据阳光辨别了方向，然后通过游戏的方式，鼓励同学们使用句型“我的...是...。”说出自己周围的同学的名字。大家都能够积极参与，勇敢发言。

本次课后，请同学们完成以下练习：
1.听录音，跟读中文课本第十一单元第63至66页的课文、生字和词语。熟练朗读并背诵课文《认方向》；
2. 完成中文练习册1A第68页到第83页练习。
3.复习汉语拼音课本第18课内容。
4.如果上周还未完成第十单元的汉字书写练习，本周可以继续进行书写练习。你需要将PDF文件打印出来。

下节课我们会继续中文课本第十一单元的学习。请课后多多练习，有问题随时提问。

周末愉快，下周见！
