Dear Parents and Students,

Good afternoon. Today, we discussed the common mistakes students made in the 4th unit test. We reviewed the recitation of the poem "静夜思" (Thoughts in the Silent Night). Then, we learned two more Tang poems: "登鹳雀楼" (Climbing the Stork Tower) and "春晓" (Spring Morning). We practiced recognizing the characters in these poems and understood their meanings. In class, all the students actively and loudly read along with me, good job! Through reciting the poems, they experienced the beautiful rhythm of Tang poetry and the picturesque scenes and emotions the poets wanted to convey.

At next Sunday's graduation ceremony, our entire class will recite these three poems for the whole school. Please make good use of this week to practice reading along, correct your pronunciation, and become proficient in reciting these three Tang poems. It would be even better if you can memorize them!

The details of the graduation ceremony are as follows:

Sunday, June 16, 2024, 12PM - 3PM (12PM - 1PM Potluck)
Robert Warren School, Gymnasium,
12424 Elbow Dr. SW, Calgary

Scholarships and certificates will be awarded at the ceremony. We hope all students can attend on time.

The report cards for this school year will be sent to parents individually by next Friday.

I am delighted to see the progress the students have made in their Chinese studies this year. I hope they will maintain their enthusiasm for learning Chinese. Over the summer, please encourage them to listen, speak, read, and write more in Chinese to achieve even better results next semester! 

Thank you, parents, for your support of the children's learning and my teaching throughout the year. I also welcome more communication with you regarding your child's Chinese studies.

Have a wonderful weekend!

Zhen

家长们同学们，

下午好。今天我们先讨论了第四次单元测试中同学们普遍出现的失误。复习了《静夜思》这首诗的朗读。之后我们又一起学习了两首唐诗《登鹳雀楼》和《春晓》。我们对其中出现的汉字进行了认读，并了解了这两首诗的含义。课上同学们都能跟老师一起积极且大声的朗读，提出表扬。大家通过朗诵诗歌，感受到了唐诗优美的韵律和诗人想要传递的美景与情感。

下周日的结业典礼上，我们全班同学将上台为全校同学朗读这三首唐诗。请大家利用这一周的时间，认真做跟读练习，纠正自己的发音，做到熟练朗读这三首唐诗，如果能背诵就更棒了！

结业典礼的时间和地点如下，典礼上会颁发奖学金和证书，希望同学们都能准时参加。
2024年6月16日，星期天，12PM - 3PM, (12pm -1pm Potluck)

本学年的Report card会在下周五之前单独发送给家长朋友们。

看到这一年孩子们在中文学习上的进步，我真的非常高兴。希望孩子们能够保持学习中文的热情，暑假多听、多说、多读、多写，下学期取得更优异的成绩！谢谢家长朋友们这一年对孩子们学习上的帮助和对我教学上的支持，也欢迎大家多多跟我交流孩子的中文学习。

祝大家周末愉快！
