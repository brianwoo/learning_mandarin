家长朋友们、同学们，

下午好！今天我们继续第一单元第一课的学习。首先我们以游戏的方式对上周的内容进行了复习。之后，我们围绕本课重点句型“我在中文学校学习。”和“我喜欢写汉字。”进行了词语替换练习。然后，同学们三三分组进行了对话和问答练习。通过朗读《中文学校真是好》这首儿歌，大家学习了六个生字（跑、跳、笑、以、本、领）的认读。在学习生字的过程中，我们再次复习了汉语拼音的拼读。课上同学们都能够认真练习，勇敢回答问题，课堂纪律优秀。为大家点赞。

本周作业如下：

1.听录音，每天读一遍课本1-7页内容。
2.熟练朗读并背诵课本第1页课文和第7页儿歌。
3.完成本课“汉字书写练习”，见邮件附件。请将汉字和它的拼音每天写两遍。书写汉字前，请先对照课本复习笔顺，然后一边写一边将所写汉字大声读出。可以尝试每一个汉字组一个词语。

本周我会对孩子们的练习册2A进行批改，下次上课时返还给大家。还未完成上周作业的同学们，请在本周尽快完成，并在下次上课时交给我。

如有其他问题，欢迎随时联系。

祝周末愉快！

Hi Parents and Students,

Good afternoon! Today, we continued with Lesson 1 of Unit 1. First, we reviewed last week's content through fun games. Then, we practiced sentence patterns like “我在中文学校学习I study at the Chinese school” and “我喜欢写汉字I like writing Chinese characters” by replacing different words. After that, students worked in groups of three to practice conversations and Q&A.

We also learned six new Chinese characters (跑, 跳, 笑, 以, 本, 领) through reading a nursery rhyme called “What a Great Chinese School”. While learning these characters, we reviewed Pinyin. All students practiced diligently, answered questions confidently, and followed class rules well. Great job, everyone!

Here is the homework for this week:

1. Listen to the audio and read pages 1-7 of the textbook once a day.
2. Read and memorize the text on page 1 and the song on page 7.
3. Complete the “Lesson01_writing_practice” attached in the email. Please write each character and its pinyin twice a day. Before writing, review the stroke order from the textbook. Write each character while saying it aloud, and try to make a word with each one.

This week, I will check students' 2A workbooks and return them in the next class. For students who haven’t completed last week's homework, please finish it and submit it to me next class.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

Zhen
