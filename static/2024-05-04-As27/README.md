Dear parents and students,

Good afternoon. Today, we began our class with a small quiz to assess the familiarity of the students with Unit 11's text and new vocabulary. It helped identify areas for improvement and provided an opportunity for them to reinforce their understanding. The results of the quiz have been graded and returned to everyone. Parents, please take a moment to ask about your child's performance today and offer appropriate praise or encouragement.

Our main focus today was on the content of Unit 12. By reading the text "Spring Festival is Coming" we learned the pronunciation, meanings, and writing of 12 new characters: 新、到、热、闹、穿、衣、戴、帽、祝、身、体、习. This unit introduces characters with multiple strokes, so it's important for students to carefully observe the structure of each character before writing (Is it a top-bottom structure? Left-right? Or surrounding structure?). They can break down complex characters into parts and practise writing them following the stroke order, while also using radicals to aid in memorizing meanings. Based on observations during class, common areas where students struggle with proper writing include: the 9th stroke of "新" should be a dot, not a horizontal stroke; the 6th stroke of "到" should be a rising stroke, not a horizontal one; and "身" consists of two horizontal strokes inside the boundary.

Regarding pronunciation, it's essential for students to differentiate between similar-sounding characters, such as "祝zhù" and "足zú", "身shēn" and "生shēng", "习xí" and "西xī". We also practised forming words using these characters in combination with the text. After studying the text, we discussed how we celebrate the Lunar New Year.

One of the key sentences we focused on today was "新年真热闹." The structure is Subject + "真" + Predicate (Adjective). "真" acts as an adverb, meaning "indeed" or "really." Another sentence we learned was "新年到了," with the structure Subject + "到了", expressing the arrival of something or someone. I encourage students to use these sentence structures at home to construct their own sentences. In our next class, we'll expand on these structures with vocabulary extension and substitution exercises.

By checking their workbooks, I noticed that some students haven't corrected their previous mistakes. Please remind your child to rectify any errors in his/her workbook. For those who haven't completed the exercises as required, please help them plan their study time and catch up as soon as possible. If there are any questions or concerns, feel free to contact me anytime.

After class, please complete the following exercises：
1.Listen to the recording and repeat the text, words, phrases and sentences on page 69 to 73 of Unit 12. Read and recite the text “Spring Festival is Coming”.
2.Complete exercises from page 70 to 83 in Chinese workbook 1B.
3.Read Pinyin list (initials, finals, and sight words) once a day.
4.Refer to the textbook and correct the errors in today’s quiz.

We will keep working on Unit 12 next week. Please keep practising.

Have a great weekend and see you next Saturday.

家长朋友们同学们，

 

下午好。今天我们课前做了一个随堂小测验，检验了下孩子们对第十一单元的课文的和生字的熟悉程度，帮助孩子们查漏补缺。检测结果已经批改好返还给了大家。家长朋友们可以问一下孩子今天完成的如何，给予适当的表扬或督促。

今天我们主要学习了中文第十二单元的内容。通过阅读课文《新年到》，我们学习了（新、到、热、闹、穿、衣、戴、帽、祝、身、体、习）共12个汉字的的读音、含义和书写。本单元的生字笔划比较多。因此在写字前，需要孩子们认真观察汉字的结构（是上下结构？是左右结构？还是包围或半包围结构？）。可以将一个复杂汉字拆解为若干个部分，然后按照汉字书写笔顺进行书写练习，同时利用汉字偏旁来帮助记忆汉字含义。通过课上观察孩子们的书写，以下为普遍容易写不规范的地方：“新”的第九画是点，不是捺；“到”的第六画是提不是横；“身”上边框里有两横。发音部分，需要区别读音相近的字，如“祝”和“足”，“身”和“生”，“习”和“西”等。我们结合课文，也对这些生字进行了组词练习。学习完课文，大家也一起回忆并积极描述自己家是怎样庆祝农历新年的。

今天学习的重点句子是“新年真热闹。”句型结构为 主语+“真”+谓语（形容词）。“真”在这里是副词，表示“的确，实在”。另外一句是“新年到了。”句型结构为 主语+“到了”。用来表达某物或人已到达的状态。在家可以鼓励孩子们用今天学习的句型造句。下次课上我也会带孩子们围绕这个句型进行词语扩展和替换的练习。

通过检查孩子们的练习册，我观察到还有同学没有将之前出错的地方修改正确。请家长朋友们多提醒孩子及时修改练习册上的错误，提高复习效果。也请还没有按要求完成练习的同学，能够规划好复习时间，尽快将练习补做。如果在练习过程中有任何疑问，欢迎随时联系我。

 

本次课后，请同学们完成以下练习：

1. 听录音，跟读中文课本第十二单元第69和73页的课文、生字和词语。熟练朗读并背诵课文《新年到》；

2. 完成中文练习册1B第70页到第83页练习。

3. 大声朗读汉语拼音声母表、韵母表和整体认读音节。每天一遍。

4. 对照课本，改正本次随堂小测验里的错误。



下节课我们会继续中文课本第十二单元的学习。请孩子们课后认真复习。

 

祝大家周末愉快，下周六见！
