家长朋友们、同学们，

下午好，今天我们先复习了上节课学习的内容，然后完成了第2课剩余内容的学习。围绕句型“这是你的书吗？”我们进行了词组替换练习。并且学习了，如何将一个陈述句改写成疑问句。结合课本对话练习，同学们两两分组进行问答训练。本节课的课文是一封信。通过阅读这封信，孩子们一起思考了“我”的进步，把以前的“我”和现在的“我”进行了对比。通过学习课文，我们以游戏的方式认识了6个新的汉字，学习了它们的读音和涵义：请、叫、都、用、还、心。并且尝试用每一个生字组一个词语。

本次课后，请孩子们完成以下练习：
1.听录音，跟读课本第2课的内容，P8-14；
2.背诵课文《我长大了》，P13；
3.打印并完成第2课汉字书写练习，见附件；
4.修改2A练习册第1课中出现的错误。

如果您和孩子还有任何疑问，请随时练习我。

周末愉快！

Dear parents and students,

Good afternoon! Today, we started by reviewing the material from the last lesson. Then, we completed the remaining content of Lesson 2. We practiced sentence structure by replacing words in the phrase “这是你的书吗？Is this your book?” and also learned how to change a statement into a question. In pairs, students took turns asking and answering questions based on dialogues in the textbook.

The text we studied today was a letter. Through reading this letter, the children reflected on their progress by comparing the "old me" and the "new me." During the lesson, we also learned six new characters in a fun and interactive way: 请, 叫, 都, 用, 还, 心. We practiced their pronunciation, meaning, and tried to make words and phrases with each one.

For homework, please complete the following exercises:
1. Listen to the recording and read along with the textbook for Lesson 2, pages 8-14.
2. Recite the text “我长大了I have Grown Up” on page 13.
3. Print and complete the character writing practice for Lesson 2 (see attachment).
4. Correct the mistakes found in the workbook 2A for Lesson 1.

If you or your child have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Have a great weekend!

Zhen
