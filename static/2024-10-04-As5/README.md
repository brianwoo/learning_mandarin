家长朋友们同学们，

下午好。今天我们学习了第3课P15-19的内容，包括课文朗读和13个生字（放、今、星、期、告、诉、午、朋、友、问、谁、听、心）的读音、涵义与书写。并且同学们使用生字练习了组词。同学们学习了如何用中文表达一周七天，以及本课重点句型——疑问句“他是谁？”其句型结构为“主语 + 判断词 + 谁？” 下节课我们会继续学习第3课剩余内容，并进行拓展练习。

通过课上观察同学们的书写和朗读练习，以下几点需要重点关注：
1.本课生字中的“放”、“星”、“朋”、“听”全部为后鼻音韵母，注意与前鼻音区分；
2.“诉”的声母是平舌音，“谁”的声母是翘舌音，注意区别；
3.“心”的第二画为卧勾，不是竖折。也要注意第四画和第五画两个点的位置；
4.书写“星”时，上面的日要写的扁一些；
5.书写“午”时，竖不可以超出第一个横。

课后请同学们完成以下练习：
1.听录音，跟读课本第15页至19页内容。背诵课文《放学了》；
2.完成中文2A练习册第3课的练习（第14页至27页）；
3.修改2B练习册中的错误。

下周六（10月12日）遇感恩节长假，课程暂停一次。10月19日恢复正常上课。

如果您还有任何问题，或者孩子们在平时复习时遇到任何困难，欢迎给我发email。

周末愉快！



Hi Parents and Students,

Good afternoon! Today, we covered Lesson 3 (pages 15-19), including reading the text and learning 13 new Chinese characters: 放, 今, 星, 期, 告, 诉, 午, 朋, 友, 问, 谁, 听, 心. We focused on their pronunciation, meanings, and writing. The students also practiced forming words with these characters. Additionally, they learned how to express the seven days of the week in Chinese and practiced the key sentence pattern: "他是谁?" (Who is he?), which follows the structure "Subject + Verb + 谁?" Next lesson, we will continue with the remaining content of Lesson 3 and do some extended exercises.

Based on today's class, here are some important points to pay attention to:
1. The characters "放," "星," "朋," and "听" all have final sounds with a back nasal (后鼻音). Please make sure to differentiate them from front nasal sounds (前鼻音).
2. The initial sound of "诉" is a flat tongue sound (平舌音), while "谁" starts with a curled tongue sound (翘舌音). Pay attention to this difference.
3. For the character "心," the second stroke should be a lying hook, not a vertical bend. Also, be mindful of the placement of the two dots in the fourth and fifth strokes.
4. When writing "星," the top part (日) should be written flatter.
5. For "午," the vertical stroke should not go beyond the first horizontal stroke.

Homework for this week:
1. Listen to the recording and read aloud the text on pages 15-19. Memorize the text "放学了Class is Over."
2. Complete the exercises for Lesson 3 in the Chinese 2A workbook (pages 14-27).
3. Correct any mistakes in the 2B workbook.

There will be no class next Saturday, October 12, due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Class will resume on October 19.

If you have any questions or if your child needs help with review, feel free to email me.

Have a great weekend!
