Dear parents and students,

Good evening!
In today's class, we started by reviewing the vocabulary and text from Lesson 1. Then, we moved on to pages 8 to 11 of Lesson 2. We learned the characters: "教 (jiāo/jiào), 室, 里, 书, 吗, 不, 那, 她, 笔, 本, 子, 讲." We focused on their pronunciation, meanings, and how to write them. Together, we discussed the structure, stroke order, and radicals of each character and did some practice with forming words. I’m happy to see that all students were able to focus and complete the writing exercises carefully as instructed. Great job everyone!

The text for this lesson is a short dialogue, and students practiced it in groups. We also learned the question sentence: "这是你的书吗？" (Is this your book?). Next class, we will continue practicing this sentence structure.

When reviewing, please remind your child of the following:
1. For pronunciation: The initials of "室shì" and "书shū" are retroflex sounds, so be sure to pronounce them clearly. "子" in "本子zi", "里" in "教室里li", and "吗ma" are neutral tones.
2. "教" has two pronunciations: jiāo and jiào. In this lesson, the "教" in "教室" is pronounced with the fourth tone (jiào). Be sure to differentiate it from the "教" in "老师教我们说汉语" (Lesson 1), where it’s pronounced in the first tone (jiāo). The character has a left-right structure, and the radical is “攵”, not "夂."
3. When writing "书", don’t forget the dot as the fourth stroke.
4. The seventh stroke of "笔" is a downward stroke (撇), not a horizontal line.
5. When reviewing "她", compare it with "他" and "地" to see the difference.

I’ve returned the 2A workbook to the students. Please assist your child in carefully reviewing the corrected exercises. For mistakes, use a pen of a different color to write the correct answers beside the errors—there's no need to erase the original answer. Also, please complete any unfinished exercises.

This week's homework:
1. Listen to the audio recording and read pages 8 to 11 from the textbook once a day.
2. Complete pages 1 to 15 of workbook 2B.
3. Correct the errors in workbook 2A.

I’ve attached the audio file and the answer keys for Lessons 1 and 2 for your child to use when reviewing. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

Have a great weekend!

家长朋友们、同学们，

晚上好！今天课上我们先复习了中文课本第1课的生字和课文，之后我们学习了第2课第8至11页的内容。我们学习了汉字“教、室、里、书、吗、不、那、她、笔、本、子、讲”的读音、涵义和书写。我们一起讨论了每个字的字形结构、笔顺和部首，并尝了组词练习。每个孩子都能够认真按要求完成课堂书写任务，提出表扬！本课的课文为一个对话，同学们分组做了对话练习，并且学习了问句“这是你的书吗？”下节课我们会继续围绕这个句子进行拓展练习。

复习时，请孩子们注意：
1.读音方面，“室”、“书”的声母是翘舌音，要读准。“本子”的“子”、“教室里”的“里”、“吗”是轻声，不标声调。
2.“教”有两个读音，分别为jiāo和jiào。本课学习的词组“教室”的“教”读作四声。注意区别第1课中出现的“老师教我们说汉语”中“教”的读音（一声）。它是左右结构，部首是“攵”不要将它写成“夂”
3.写“书”时， 注意不要忘记第四画的点。
4.“笔”的第七画是撇，不是横
5.复习“她”时，可以对照“他”“地”字。

我已将2A练习册返还给了孩子们。请家长朋友们协助您的孩子，仔细翻看已批阅的练习。将错误答案改正。在改错时，请用一只不同颜色的笔，将正确答案写在旁边，不需要擦掉错误答案。补做未完成的练习。

本周课后作业：
1.听录音，朗读课本第8页至第11页的内容。每天一遍。
2.完成练习册2B第1页至第15页的内容。
3.修改2A练习册的错误答案。

邮件附件为录音、练习册第1课和第2课的参考答案，供孩子们复习参考。若有疑问随时联系。

祝大家周末愉快！
