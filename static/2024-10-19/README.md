家长朋友们，同学们，

下午好！今天，我们首先对上节课所学的生字进行了复习和组词练习。参考课本20页对话练习，围绕“他是谁？”这句话，我们一起练习了如何用“谁”进行询问。并且我们进行了主语的替换，并练习了对应的回答。建议家长朋友们在家里多用“谁”或“谁的”对孩子进行提问。例如可以问一问“谁是你的老师？”“谁是你的好朋友？”“这是谁的课本？”帮助孩子对“谁”和“谁的”有更深刻的了解。
今天学习的课文是《云云画画儿》。需要孩子们分清楚，词组“画画儿”的第一个“画”是动词，“画儿”是名词。当出现儿化音时，可以在拼音后面加一个“r”表示儿化音。如“画儿”的拼音写作huar，而非hua er。通过学习课文，我们还认识了六个新的生字（拿、先、鸡、再、听、话）和三个词语（每天、听话、画家）。请注意“拿”的声母是“n”，不是“l”。“拿”是一个手部动作，所以“拿”有汉字部件“手”。平时可以鼓励孩子多观察汉字部件，以帮助启发孩子识记字义。另外，“先”和“再”表示时间或者次序，两个词常常一起使用。

课后请孩子们完成以下练习：
1.听录音，大声朗读课本第15页至21页内容。熟读，然后背诵《云云画画儿》。
2.打印并完成“中文02_Lesson03_汉字书写练习.pdf”（见附件）
3.改正上次作业中出现的错误。

请记得提醒孩子们在自己的课本和练习册上写上姓名，避免跟其他同学的课本混淆。下次上课时，请带好铅笔、橡皮、课本和练习册。
下次课为单元总复习课。11月2日为第一次单元测试，请孩子们认真复习，提前做好准备。

如果您还有任何问题，或者孩子们在平时复习时遇到任何困难，欢迎随时联系。

祝大家周末愉快！

Dear Parents and Students,

Good afternoon!

Today, we began by reviewing the new characters from the previous lesson and practiced forming words with them. Referring to the dialogue exercise on page 20 of the textbook, we focused on the question “他是谁？Who is he?” and practiced how to use the word “谁who” to ask questions. We also worked on replacing the subject in the sentences and practiced how to respond correctly. I suggest parents use “谁who” or “谁的whose” more often at home to ask questions. For example, you can ask, “谁是你的老师？Who is your teacher?” “谁是你的好朋友？Who is your best friend?” or “这是谁的课本？Whose textbook is this?” This will help your child better understand how to use “谁” and “谁的”.

We also learned the text “Yunyun Is Drawing Pictures”. It’s important for the students to understand that in the phrase “画画儿,” the first “画” is a verb (to draw), and “画儿” is a noun (picture). When the “儿” sound is added at the end, we show it in pinyin with an “r” (huàr, not huà er).

Through studying the text, we also learned six new characters: 拿 (ná), 先 (xiān), 鸡 (jī), 再 (zài), 听 (tīng), 话 (huà), and three new words: 每天 (everyday), 听话 (behave), 画家 (artist). Please note that the initial sound of “拿” is “n,” not “l.” “拿” is an action done with the hand, so the character includes the “手hand” component. It can be helpful for child to pay attention to the components of Chinese characters, as this can aid in understanding the meaning. Additionally, “先” (first) and “再” (then) indicate time or sequence and are often used together.

For homework, please complete the following:
1. Listen to the recording and read aloud the content from pages 15 to 21 of the textbook. Read then memorize the text “Yunyun Is Drawing Pictures云云画画儿”。
2. Print and complete the worksheet “中文02_Lesson03_汉字书写练习.pdf” (attached).
3. Correct any mistakes from the last homework assignment.

Please remind your child to write their name on their textbooks and workbooks to avoid mixing them up with other students'. For the next class, ensure they bring a pencil, eraser, textbooks, and workbooks.

The next lesson will be a review of the whole unit. On November 2nd, we will have our first unit test, so please help your child prepare well in advance.

If you have any questions or if your child needs help while reviewing, feel free to reach out to me anytime.

Have a great weekend!
Zhen
